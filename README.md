# Minish AP Rando Patches

This is a fork of LeonarthCG's original patches for the
[Minish Cap Randomizer by MinishMaker](https://github.com/minishmaker/randomizer).

I'm using their work as a foundation for [my Archipelago APWorld](https://github.com/eternalcode0/Archipelago/tree/feat/new-game-minish-cap/worlds/tmc).

Continued is the original README from the base repository.

# Minish Rando original patches archive
 A repository holding the original form of the patches used in the Minish Maker team's randomizer.

The purpose of this repository is to clarify the license of these game modifications, along with the source files, in an explicit way

In the future, this may be expanded to hold the patch sets for different specific old versions of the randomizer, provided all parties involved in their making allow for it.
